# NYC Mesh-Inspired Community Internet Project 🌐
This is a simple, mobile-responsive landing page for a community-powered internet network modeled after NYC Mesh — a grassroots initiative that believes internet access should be affordable, open, and available to everyone.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Too many communities still lack fast, reliable internet because of high costs or lack of infrastructure. Projects like NYC Mesh prove that we can create decentralized, locally-managed networks that connect underserved areas — and that’s exactly what inspired me to build this.

As someone passionate about tech for good, I created this donation landing page to simulate what a nonprofit like NYC Mesh might use to attract and engage supporters. I’ve included a working Paystack integration to demonstrate real-world functionality.
